#### 10 Faculty. 2 Departments. 1 Mission. Infinite Possibilites: PL Research at Purdue. #####

PurPL is the cross-departmental umbrella group for programming languages research at Purdue University. PurPL research groups push the boundaries of every area in programming languages and software engineering: PL theory, language-based security, compiler optimizations, verification, program synthesis, and more. But we do more than just fundamental PL/SE research: we bring PL/SE ideas to bear on a wide range of areas, including big data, security, and computational science.
